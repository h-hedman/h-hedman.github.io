  Developed during an emergency response with the CDC, this tool automated daily outbreak reports across refugee camps. It parsed medical notes to identify infectious disease conditions and produced formatted PDF reports, replacing a manual process that previously required several hours. The tool was later scaled for national use in settings with limited internet access.</p>
