# Data Files

This folder contains static CSV files used to demonstrate data sources and support live visualizations or tables on associated project pages (e.g., `quarantine_engine.html`).

All datasets are synthetic or publicly available and are included here to enable interactive components and dashboards in the portfolio.

> Note: These files are not intended for standalone analysis and may be regenerated or updated periodically to support frontend displays.
