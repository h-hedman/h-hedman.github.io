# Hayden Hedman, PhD  
## Applied Data Scientist

- *PhD – School for Environment and Sustainability, University of Michigan* (2013-2019)
- *MS – Computer Science, Georgia Institute of Technology* (2024-2026)

I’ve led data science efforts across federal public health and international development, serving as a technical lead for the CDC and U.S. Department of State. My work spans comparative effectiveness research, supply chain optimization, critical resource allocation, financial modeling, and national emergency response analytics.

I build practical, scalable data pipelines and apply machine learning in settings where the stakes are high and the systems are complex. This portfolio showcases a few of the projects I’ve worked on, including outcomes modeling, e-commerce forecasting, and experimental ML tools.
