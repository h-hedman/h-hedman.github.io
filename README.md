Applied Data Science | ML Systems

- PhD – School for Environment and Sustainability, University of Michigan (2013-2019)
- MS – Computer Science, Georgia Institute of Technology (2024-2026)

I’ve led data science efforts across federal public health and international development, serving as a technical lead for the CDC and U.S. Department of State. My work spans comparative effectiveness research, supply chain optimization, critical resource allocation, financial modeling, and national emergency response analytics.

I focus on building scalable pipelines, applying machine learning in high-impact environments, and translating complex systems into actionable insights. This portfolio highlights selected projects aligned with that approach — including outcomes modeling, e-commerce forecasting, and experimental ML systems.
