I’ve led national-scale analytics efforts in public health, infrastructure, and supply chain domains. My work blends statistical modeling, machine learning, and systems thinking — with an emphasis on scalable, interpretable solutions.

Most of my production work lives behind firewalls, but here’s a selection of open projects I’m currently building or adapting.
